# Generate Latex Tables in Python

For any significant work where you need to keep updating results for your tables as you run new things, generate the latex table text in python, since you probably already have all of the data loaded into the analysis scripts anyway. This way you don't have to deal with manually bringing data into online latex table creators, you can get formatting right once and never worry about it again, etc.

Similarly, in that latex table text output, put (in a latex comment) the command used to run the analysis script (that also generates the table) so you don't have to think about how to regenerate the table when you need it
